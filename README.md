# Cruise Management System
## Description
- This is a Cruise Management System project developed by me and my four partners for our CS4400 final project. The system is designed to efficiently manage and analyze cruise-related data for port authorities. The system tracks ships, ports, and cruise routes while managing passenger and crew assignments alongside cruise progression.
## Key Features:
- **Ship and Port Tracking**: Manages ship status, capacity, peak speeds, and classification (riverboats and ocean liners).
- **Route and Leg Governance**: Tracks predetermined routes with legs, post order, and distance traveled.
- **Passenger and Crew Management**: Supervises bookings, credit balances, and loyalty miles while tracking crew assignments and licenses.
- **Status and Safety**: Manages departure and arrival times while updating the cruise state (sailing or docked) while ensuring ship capacity and passenger counts are appropriate before departure.
