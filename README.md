# Cruise Management System
## Description
- This is a Cruise Management System project developed by me and my 4 partners for our CS4400 final project. The system is designed to efficiently manage and analyze cruise-related data for port authorities. The system tracks ships, ports, and cruise routes while managing passenger and crew assignments alongside cruise progression.
## Key Features:
- *Ship and Port Tracking*: Managed ship status, capacity, peak speeds, and classification (riverboats and ocean liners).
